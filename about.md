Welcome to my personal site. I am a software engineer, who live on the west coast of United States. I love technology (mostly software development related), but also believe there is an artist in my heart.

With this site, I would like to share my learning, ideas, and interesting things in life. Hope you would find it useful or just enjoyable.

This site is a fork from [Not Pure Poole](https://github.com/vszhub/not-pure-poole). Thanks for the author to save me tons of time!
